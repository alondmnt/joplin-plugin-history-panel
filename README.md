## Use cases

The above setup enables some interesting use cases.

- View your (desktop) history on mobile by opening the history note.
- Sync and combine your history across devices.
- Keep separate histories for work, different projects and so on, by maintaining multiple history notes and switching between them during app use.
- [Backlinks / referrers](https://github.com/ylc395/joplin-plugin-note-link-system) will point back to all the visits of the currently viewed note that are documented in any of the history logs.
